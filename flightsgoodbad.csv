negative,"@VirginAmerica I tried that. You offered to charge me an additional $1k for a new ticket or be stranded until Thurs. 1st time, last time."
negative,"@VirginAmerica Never had a bad experience before, but this one took the cake. Now extortion for carry on items as well?"
negative,@VirginAmerica Had to spend 5 hours worrying that items in carryon would be broken/stolen since I couldn't carry them on plane or lock bag.
negative,"@VirginAmerica All of group E was told there was no more room in the bins. when I got on the plane, was room for at least 4 bags in my row!"

positive,".@VirginAmerica not only was it great, but you return my calls the day after. Couldn't ask for more. #myVXexperience"
negative,"@VirginAmerica While other airlines weren't Cancelled Flighting flights into BOS, and helping their customers get home, Virgin was saying Good luck!"
negative,@VirginAmerica Grouping Virgin in with the others now. BOS weather has exposed their actual Cus Serv model. Never Flight Booking Problems with Virgin again!
negative,"@VirginAmerica As one of the travelers affected by the Boston storm, I'm shocked at Virgin's complete apathy toward their customers."
negative,@VirginAmerica Umm so no reason as to why this is? Is there someone different I should contact (or contact me) to get a definitive answer?
negative,@virginamerica Trying to make the change in advance (not just 24 hours prior)‚Ä¶tried it online earlier and it wanted $300 in change fees.

negative,@united you think you boarded flight AU1066 too early? I think so.
negative,"@united Gate agent hooked me up with alternate flights. If you have a way to PREVENT the constant issues, that would rock."
positive,@united thanks
positive,@united Thanks. It is on the same ticket.
negative,@united is the worst. Nonrefundable First class tickets? Oh because when you select Global/FC their system auto selects economy w/upgrade.
negative,@united @CheerTymeDad So I can buy tix 3 days before flight but can't transfer the tix.  Flawed security logic. Flawed customer service
negative,"@united I did start a claim but 8-10 weeks is unrealistic, am I really supposed to go that long with out a car seat for my child.Ridiculous!"
positive,@united follow me please this airline is beautifull ‚ô•

negative,"@united See? We were told repeatedly that the pilot was Late Flight and kept getting Late Flightr.  After we boarded, there was a defibrillator issue."

negative,"@united yes please! I am newly married and trying to update my last name on a preexisting international flight! It seems so easy, but..."
negative,@united How does United refuse to reissue a $400 lost voucher when their plane didn't take off due to mechanics? #badcustomerservice
negative,"@united also during the run I was instructed to do, I shattered my computer. http://t.co/oAflfr7WXB"

positive,"@united - thanks for your help...got me what I need, but its an issue with @_austrian . I guess I sit awhile longer."
negative,@united @UCtraveladvisor - I would have loved to respond to your website until I saw the really long form. In business the new seats are bad
negative,@united A refund and flight vouchers or another flight on a different airline at your expense for today. 8 hour drive is very inconvenient

negative,@United  My bag is still in Colo Springs. I am disabled and have to search an unfamiliar airport and look for my bag. Not a good outcome
negative,@united Shame that there's no flex to tickets transfer rules.  Even calling from Neurosurgery ICU isn't enough!
negative,@united No. Denver said they don't handle baggage that made it to Colo. Springs.  They gave me an 800 number to call. No help there either.
negative,@united you guys need some serious training in customer service. Too many better options to put up with the way you guys handle ur mistakes

negative,@united OKC ticket agent Roger McLarren(sp?) LESS than helpful with our Intl group travel problems Can't find a supervisor for help.
negative,@united mobile apps need construction from the ground up for each OS category.  It's expensive to get right .
negative,@united another fail for the United ticket agents in OKC. LESS than helpful and could care less about our problems. American here we come.

negative,@united What is your phone number. I can't find who to call about a flight reservation.
negative,"@united well, you can't fix me missing my buddies 30th bday because of negligence but you can attempt to make up for it."
negative,"@united why am I to believe they will help when customer service couldn't? Like I said, I want a number to someone who can fix what you did."

negative,@united what's the point of asking for details about a #servicedog when you book if your flight crew doesn't read them? (Continued)
negative,@united I tried but no one was available in bogota and everyone was rude in Houston. I was stuck for 35 hours because of you guys

negative,@united Blackmailed me into paying ¬£130 extra or having my return ticket nullified in San Francisco Airport. Terrible service from rep #scam
negative,@united disappointed that u didnt honor my $100 credit given to me for ur mistakes. Taking my business elsewhere  ‚úåÔ∏èout.

negative,@united 2nd flight also delayed no pilots! But they boarded is so we can just sit here! #scheduling
negative,@united but it's hard to stay upset at someone when they at least TRY to show remorse.
negative,"@united By the way, a simple apology goes a long way, even if it's a hollow one. It's obvious that you don't care about me or my well-being,"
negative,@united This isn't a one time thing either! It's a shocking pattern of repeated neglect and disrespect.
negative,@united Fingers crossed &amp; its all intact. Very disappointed with this experience as before this we were actually saying we enjoyed using you
negative,"@united It's an incredibly easy fix, but you would rather stay in your comfort zone, while I get forced out of mine."
negative,@united ours in July. You have ZERO excuses for this. You have an out-of-date system that causes problems like this.
negative,@united Everyone around us is sitting with their friends and family members. They booked their tickets in October and December. We bought

negative,"@united I asked a legitimate question about systemwide vs. localized problems, and got back an unreLate Flightd copy/paste. You can do better."
negative,@united what time? Who can I call. I need my skis. I will go to the airport and get them. No more faith in United.
negative,@united I see you guys are at it again. Amazing how one company continually makes mistakes yet fails to be held accountable for their error
negative,@united Yeah sorry but there's always a problem with United. And you have an international reputation for having problems.
negative,"@united but then again, maybe the @BBBNE_SD_KS_IA would care more to hear what went on than whoever listens to issues you caused"
negative,@united I wonder if sharing all this on FB and insta would produce a number. 140 characters really limits my story telling.
negative,@united so you're telling me there is no number to call after being left in an airport because of a negligent pilot and staff?
negative,@united Could this email be resent as it doesnt appear to have arrived.

negative,"@united according to your DMs, I'm not owed a refund. please may I be provided with a contact number before I go to my bank to file claim"
negative,@united about 3 hours ago. I need to work out if my bag can make it to my hotel here in time or if it will need to go elsewhere.
negative,@united pls properly train your agents. Requested to speak to 1k customer service &amp; was transferred to a dead end. Not even open at this hr
negative,@united Thanks for remembering to load my bag onto my connecting flight. Oh wait you forgot. Iceland should be fun with no clothes....
positive,@united Thank you for the cheese platter and abundance of entertainment options. Time just flew by.
negative,"@united customer service is atrocious! You have disrupted my travel plans, you have lost my luggage and it is impossible to TALK TO A HUMAN"

negative,@united LHR arrival lounge #fail. Waited 20 mins for shower then left to find hotel. U know how many passengers u carry. Planning???
negative,@united completed form but doubt it's any use. UA doesn't care. 6 day vacation will now be 5. Sure UA won't feel responsibility for that...
positive,@united Definitely a compliment! I really thought my bag was lost after it was sent on to another airport. In the end I am a happy customer

negative,"@united frankly worse customer service ever. Problems will happen, how you deal defines a company. Never again United."

negative,@united Thanks for the lack of help and the canned response from the 1K desk!
negative,@united   It's too bad UA has had another unforeseeable operational issue on my return flight.
negative,@united if I pay you $25 and $35 for my luggage to be delivered when I arrive. Why should I have to wait 3 additional days for its delivery?

negative,"@united it's frustrating, as a frequent flyer, loyal since Continental. Upgrade equals paying 3 times or more on top of purchase ticket."
negative,"@united at its worse. Can't figure how to pack plane, screws up connectns then claims no hotl rooms in San Fran for stranded pax. Way to go!"
negative,@united 4 passengers after a 2 hour delayed flight left with no hotel at the end of the night @ hou airport. Wtf??!! http://t.co/ZfqMpGXVS6
negative,"Hey @united why does the flight from IAH to POS leave so Late Flight, and the one back to IAH so early? I rather get to POS earlier"
negative,@united Lost bag process is broken. Agent promised they'd call &amp; hold my bag when found. Now they're waking me at 3am w/ delivery. #fail
negative,@united the people at the counter have been very helpful. As you can see nobody is there. Flight to Austin 10:55 and still sitting here.
negative,‚Äú@united: @Darquenloveli We regret to hear this. Please let us know if you need assistance. ^KN‚Äù I was finally able to secure my seat. Thx
negative,"@united good to know you will open the closed doors for ""premier passengers"" after safety briefings on delayed flights. #annoyed."
negative,@united yea get me to phoenix already. Delays all day with you people. It's bullshit.
negative,"@united If it's any consolation, your staff was stellar. Just not the hour+ delays I encountered with every one of my 4 flights."
positive,"@united flight ua3576, gate b1. And tell ray I somehow made it on to the 736 flight out of IAH and didn't have to wait for the 917 one. :)"
negative,@united that's unfortunate. The @Tumitravel was an xmas gift and it looks like a razor ripped right through the front pocket in the picture
positive,@united But thanks for asking
negative,@united Lost bags. Cancelled Flightled flights. Delhi call centers. Poor United staff spread thin and stressed. You name it.
negative,@united Yes. Doesn't make that mistake any less absurd. Doesn't change the fact that I'm very inconveniently missing my luggage tonight.
negative,@united I'm constantly having challenges with upgrades &amp; charges. In order to prevent DVT I have to pay an addtl $180 http://t.co/xC6jQ70r7B
negative,"@united In ORD, waited 20 min after crew members left before gate items came. Flight attendant sarcastically said good luck and walked away."
positive,@united you too!
positive,@united is my favorite airline.
negative,@united seriously #fail on making strangers share a room
negative,@united we needed them here asap. Will they make it on today's flight?
negative,@united agent split up my reservation? Now can't Cancelled Flight and refund credit for 2wks? Why
negative,@united why would they make me share a room?
negative,"@united tried calling too, but w/25 min phn wait means we'd miss options anyway"
negative,@united can you ask your guys with flight 1146 to BWI to wait for us to get off a delayed flight from San Diego? Pretty please?
negative,@united we're still waiting to find out your rep is working hard - most upset about having to wait to tomorrow pm to get to mammoth
negative,"@united for an early flt, I think a call is appropriate. Yes, reviewed and nada avail until next day. Expect full refund"
negative,"@united again I ask, who can I call to get this fixed? Tweeting me BS questions to stall only makes things worse. Phone number please."
negative,@united Yo yo yo stuck on the tarmac for over 2 hours at @fly2ohare ... Going to miss my ride at @flypdx help please! #HelpImStuck #United
negative,@united it's highly unprofessional for you to overbook a flight by 12 seats &amp;feel that I should rearrange my schedule for your mismanagement
negative,"@united well, considering every agent before claimed they were unable to help with everything else, why waste more time to hear 'call corp'"
positive,@united man I can't wait to book my ticket now! Thanks JP you're a life sabe
negative,"@united Ice, which I totally understand. But when a large number of us are facing 15+ hours of time and overnight Cancelled Flightations it seems like"
negative,@united flt 1249 Cancelled Flightled and I get email @3:30 AM? What happened to courtesy phn call? Had to book diff airline &amp; city

positive,@united you guys continue to impress me in Houston. http://t.co/cIh1qNllcM
negative,@United I have no way of making phones calls... Need to handle via Twitter/email/web. Thank you!
negative,@united Your website deserves a new design. #html5 FTW!
negative,@united thanks for effing up our holidays - we're missing a full day of skiing due to your baggage team's incompetence at @FlyYOW
negative,@united agent helps the person in front of me.  Finishes up with them and then walks away.  The guy behind me is as shocked as I am.
negative,@united Connection at ORD was on the exact same plane again. Checked carry-on was apparently taken off &amp; left in Chicago. Pretty ridiculous.
negative,@united Not encouraged that I'll have my CPAP tonight.
negative,@united Yes. Did file a claim as soon as the carousel stopped without my bag on it. Got an email that its found but not sched for delivery
negative,@united  Delay DEN-CLE because they have to manually enter baggage tags? Really? Worst cust service day for this 1ker. #friendlyskies??
negative,"@united Why tell us flight is delayed, then tell us it's on time again with 20 min to spare? Don't say it's delayed unless you're sure!"
negative,"@united yes in Lusaka, Zambia. My guess is the bags never made the plane at IAD."
negative,"@united Late Flight to Denver, Late Flight to Newark...let's not even get into the disaster that was checking bags. Unacceptable."
negative,@united has once again let me down. Don't think I've ever flown with them and not had problems. Worst airline period.
negative,@united yes I filed a claim &amp; hope to receive by luggage by 2am. Ridiculous as I had to purchase items to go to sleep &amp; no reimbursement.
negative,@united UA938 ORD-LHR.  bags are being loaded 30min Late Flight. Frigid air into cabin! Plane feels like falling apart! Upgrade long haul fleet!
negative,"@united Flight attendant never served me my beverage (tea), and not once checked up on me. What gives? #ua6076 #notcool"
negative,@united load balancing system apparently down #systemwide - major impact on all #united airlines flights. Was this a #cyberattack?
negative,@united After our unscheduled refueling stop and missing 2 connecting flights we r home n looking 4ward to our bed and a big PB&amp;J sandwich.
negative,@united @AmericanAir spent hundreds to rectify the situation and you guys go quiet
negative,@united UA276 sitting at EWR nearly an hour after sked.  Pilot says computers down but no clue when we will leave.  Can you help?
negative,@united @AmericanAir so that's it? It just ends there? Come on! I traveled for literally an extra day and a half because of this!
positive,@united Made the upgrade list. Will fly 1st tomorrow (for 40 min) for the first time ever! üôå #StatusMatchPaidOff http://t.co/ATfRKp6goY

positive,@united Thanks for the reminder. It's been a fun ride. http://t.co/pPVA4Rch9f
negative,@united I received my luggage that also looked to be left in the snow when I arrived. I'm asking for all 50 people to be refunded.
negative,@united updated A320 aircraft has wifi and device entertainment but no outlets. I don't get it. How can I charge devices?
negative,@united was no one between the scan and inside the plane. I just asked the people in line around me where the plane was going
negative,"@united 5 gate changes, two delays.  Even the crew thinks the airline sucks"
negative,@united I'm very frustrated and have wasted 2 days now due to your equipment failures.
negative,@united computers are down but you stopped giving updates and took my flight info off the app. That's just ridiculous keep people updated!
negative,"@united Soooo, it's been 15 days and you've offered no response. So I assume poor treatment by gate agents is the norm now?"
positive,@united Terrific. Many thanks. Looking forward to being back on UA tomorrow. Had a great flight up to Vancouver.
negative,@united Calls to 800# resulted in 2hrs of hold time &amp; 2day wait to check suspect code share fare. Nothing investigated‚Äîmy time wasted (2/2)
negative,"@united It's taken ~3 weeks for Cust Care to respond to Case #8477733, requesting a refund for wi-fi not working. Where can I get an update?"
positive,@united I appreciate your efforts getting me home!
negative,@united That's correct‚ÄîI've spent hours trying to book online only to receive an error when clicking final purchase button. (1/2)
negative,@united Today was not your finest. All could have been prevented by one gate agent advising 200 passengers.
negative,@united  what is the real deal with the delay on flight UA 1032 from Denver to Vegas?
negative,@united UA63 from Madrid arrived no agent mass confusion we sent to and fro by 3 UA employees. MaryJo was rude and unhelpful.
negative,@united system failure again = bad trend.  Software projects are like flying an airplane; there's no such thing as an emergency takeoff.
negative,@united lots of reports of system failures delaying flights over the last week. Currently sitting on the tarmac at OGG for over an hour.
positive,"@united despite shaky connections, looks like I'll get home tonight. Great job, @united - was touch and go for a while.."

negative,@united GRK13575M is the file reference
negative,@united we would...how do I contact you to discuss? A few poor experiences with customer service but would give it a shot!
negative,"@united UA 746. Pacific Rim and Date Night cut out. Not constantly or randomly, but one spot, repeatably."
negative,@united Been trying since 1230 to file a report.
negative,@united I send an email about my bad experience and you send back a generic response.  Yet another reason why I'll never fly with you again.
negative,@united here is the ticket # 0162424965446 please refund my unnecessary upgrade fee
negative,"@united is horrible!! They lost our carseat and expect us to use a loner carseat, safety regulations say it's illegal to use a used car seat"
positive,@united thank you.

positive,@united thank you. I flew into Newark from Vail/Eagle.
negative,@united  i have a weekend of dealing with your company that would say otherwise.
negative,@United now what?!? http://t.co/5hpSqVRjK8 flight was gone when I got off plane! #BusinessTravel #goodenoughmother
negative,"@united the proper response: sorry for your wait, what flight # were you on so we can look into the issue. That's how @Delta would handle."

negative,@united searched for mileage tickets to BOM couldn't find a single one is saver awards - I see how you play.  Earn miles but can't use them.
negative,"@united flight arrives 30 minutes early, but then have we to wait for an hour for our bags."
negative,@united That's not the issue. The fact that no one even called (despite promises) to confirm the bag's location is.
negative,@united still waiting to hear back. My wallet was stolen from one of your planes so would appreciate a resolution here
negative,@united or @flysaa has lost my baggage‚Ä¶ heard different things from different employees of @united. @flysaa has said nothing.
negative,"@united cs thinks that miles can repair the damage done, it will be interesting if they travel in @united and exp the worst flight ever!"
negative,@united I am signed up for notifications. This is the first trip I was not updated on. Not sure why this happened.
positive,@united Thank you. Took care of everything and made it right. That's the experience I'm used to. Opened the app to find flight changed.
negative,@united that is not in line with your responses here. And now I'm waiting until tomorrow morning because all the flights are overbooked.
negative,"@united I took the exact same aircraft in to LAX 3 days ago. It fit, no problem. The agent today told some nonsense about a policy change"

negative,@united Exhausted &amp; frustrated! Link to a FB post abt my travel issue https://t.co/LaRKC8vc4s
negative,@united I was denied getting on the plane w/o getting the chance to prove it fits. I'm not a rookie. Read my bio.
positive,@united that's exactly the point. It fits. I'm premier access. Boarding group 2. This was a return ticket. I've been doing this for 15 yrs
negative,@united I've never experienced worst customer service. Placing blame on codeshare partners and not assuming responsibility is unacceptable
negative,@united currently on board so not now. Check in was terrible. Staff rude. Expensive luggage thrown around etc.
negative,"@United fucked up, then voided my ticket, and KEPT MY MONEY.  Not even an apology. I will never fly with your airline again. #UnitedAirlines"

negative,@united you are the worst. I will avoid you like the plague.
negative,@united is the worst airline in the world.
negative,@united someone needs to DM me and resolve this correctly. Extremely disappointed with the service I received. Terrible management.
negative,@united Premier Gold desk changes flight. Waives fees. Gives me wrong flight. Now Jana Acosta in Salt Lake refuses the same service. Angry.

negative,@united first time flying with United. Also last time. #terrible back to @VirginAtlantic for me. #branson #virginatlantic #UnitedAirlines
negative,@united I used to be a committed #ContinentalAirlines flyer until merger. I remember now why I switched to @SouthwestAir #CommunicationFail
negative,@united the least you could do is offer me a ticket in coach instead of just Cancelled Flighting my reservation because of your glitch!!! #notfair
negative,"@united I'm saying I made the flight but with poor/non-communication, unaccounted for lost time &amp; lots of frustrated flyers standing around"
negative,@united I think DM would be better
negative,@United gate announcement states delay due to maintenance yet app says Late Flight arriving aircraft  tell the truth! @unfriendly
negative,@united you are easily the worst company I have ever experienced. You have lost someone's personal possessions &amp; you couldn't care less!....
negative,@united how can your app show arriving aircraft is early but departing flight is delayed due to Late Flight arriving aircraft? @unfriendly
negative,@united already did that at the airport and 12 hrs Late Flightr its still not here! you guys are really killing me today. trying to stay positive..
negative,@united once united's service levels reaches those of Etihad or lets be more realistically Lufthansa then ill consider it again
negative,@united really?  Someone called in sick and then someone FORGOT to call a replacement?!  Now an hour Late Flight to take off. #theworst
negative,@united Asked Flight attendant what typical compensation would be &amp; says we might get free TV. #Unacceptable
negative,@united has been such a disappointment today. Simply put. Rather unpleased with things currently. Flight delayed; cant wait to just get home

negative,"@united  found a group of people who actually hates people more than ISIS, thats right United Airlines."

positive,@united thank you
negative,@united by the time I finally get to Dallas I could have driven with less frustration and cheaper.
negative,"@united I'm trying to get to my final destination, we need compensation. Just about 2hrs of personal time wasted."

positive,@united he has no priority and Iove it
positive,@united Pleased to be a Premier Platinum
negative,@united how can you not put my bag on plane to Seattle. Flight 1212. Waiting  in line to talk to someone about my bag. Status should matter.
negative,"@united @campilley hahaha. If they weren't an American company, i would say this was great sarcasm!!"
negative,@united i think he actually did not like your screen  @campilley üòÉüòÉüòÉ
negative,@united Apparently they are asking 20 people to off board the plane--how can such a big miscalculation be made?!
negative,@united It's a shame choosing #United may be the difference between reuniting with aging friends and never seeing them again #PoorService
negative,@united Just checking in again - what is the status of our claim.   It is going on 2 months with no attention to this?   We are very upset.
negative,@united my flight was delayed due to maintenance in LIT and caused me to miss my connection at IAH to MSY. Can you help?
negative,@united #UnitedAirlines Pls Fix #AspenBaggageFail issues. Had to pay my own way to #Aspen after flight Cancelled Flight. Left us in the cold in DEN.
negative,@united Read my bio. See who I work with. I have NEVER encountered this with your airline before. Disappointed is an understatement.
negative,@united Does customer care have email or a phone rep that I can speak with? We had so many issues they can't be placed in 2000 characters?
positive,Thank you ‚Äú@united: @TRUU_Tall I can certainly take a look. Please follow and DM me your confirmation number for assistance. ^JH‚Äù
negative,@united In the process of recovering their car rental - condo rental $ in Florida. They called #United for an alternate flight #NOANSWER
positive,@united thanks for listening! I definitely was not the only person in line who thought it was absurd.
negative,@United We've been waiting on tarmac for &gt;1hr because apparently UA1116 is overweight &amp; we returned to gate. #WTF #fb
negative,"@united Thank you. Mention that before I boarded she asked 1other person to measure their bag, and it was another woman. Men not asked."
negative,@united Can't leave the Tarmac ..united's gate agent cannot agree on a head count. 20 min now counting a 100 people max #epicfailunited
negative,@united That's real dedication &amp; concern. Your apologies don't fix the issue nor any of the miserable issues I've had over the past 6 mos.
negative,@United blocked me from DM'ing them because they would rather I complain about them in a public forum
positive,@united ok. I just submitted. Thanks for the opportunity to give feedback.
positive,@united Big thanks to Ms. Winston for assisting me over the phone with a baggage claim issue today. She really went the extra mile!
positive,"@united I will, as soon as I am done with my article.  Thanks!  ~Tom"
negative,@united booked flights for 2 for $779. Was charged $389.50 twice. Means I can't redeem CC points properly. Would have gone elsewhere.
negative,@united We've had a ton of problems with getting our bags and have been given the run around for a day. Whats up with that?
negative,@united pedophile airline. Split myself and my 10 yr old daughter rows apart on flight 1254 to boston
negative,@united have been waiting 2 days for my military bags from an airport 3 hours away from me. Horrible.
negative,"@united Arriving 25 minutes early is nice, but not if equipment isn't ready. Waiting 30 minutes for luggage, so far. Time gains wiped out."
negative,@united is doing musicians real dirty at LAX. I've never been blocked from getting on a flight with my bass.
negative,"@united I'm rebooked now, but the line was 300 people deep."
negative,"@united @FlyEIA yes, they said it took more than an hour!"
negative,@united those whose pay to actually fly with you over 30k/ year deserve better service than a CC holder.
positive,@united Ok thank again for your help!
negative,@united Not a happy flyer.  UA flight 1161 from SFO to Cleveland.  Sunday 2/22.  Stay tuned for blog article from http://t.co/VdFdODqVGx
positive,@united flight 1491...plane from SFO to DEN is basically on time.
positive,@united thanks. Just a program comment; the system assigned seats behind each other even though pairs were available. I changed it back.
negative,@united 20 min more delays to flt 2086 at sfo 2 load 2 more pax makes no sense. Will strand many of us overnight at ORD due to missed cnxns
negative,"@united Heads up We didn't check 8 bags, 2 we checked arrived, those aren't claim #s for our 2. Other people's bags? http://t.co/dplQ3mhQGD"

negative,"@united Change made in just over 3 hours. For something that should have taken seconds online, I am not thrilled. Loved the agent, though."
negative,@united flight attendant doesn‚Äôt understand not understanding English doesn‚Äôt mean they are deaf. Stop yelling English slowly to them.
negative,"@united Not appropriate to ask in public (hence the dm). each united employee, each a new answer. your process was such a hassle i Cancelled Flighted."
negative,@united well that's big of you but I don't have terribly high expectations at this point.
negative,@united it's like you're trying to make me hate your airline. Fee for each checked bag that's never mentioned in the ticket + rude agents üëø
negative,"@united nice your app says US 4972 delayed by weather.  Pilot says waiting on fuel.  One in ur control, one not"
positive,@united Please than Robin at EWR Premiere Desk for helping me get on a an earlier flight. She did the work.  Huge thanks.
negative,"@united Ok thank you, do you provide complimentary hotel accommodations since I'll have to stay overnight?"
negative,@united I was originally trying to share details but the link Jimmy Samartzis Vice President - Customer Experience sent me expired.
negative,"@united really? 3 hr delay, 4 gate changes, &amp; you boarded us, sent us back up, &amp; boarded us again.  Won't change our flight. Can we go now?"
positive,"@united that would help! or how about integrate it into the App so I can just ""activate"" it and surf..."
negative,@united I did. The AC went on for about 20 minutes before returning to the Mojave Desert. #PressureCooker #HeatTrap
negative,@united Nope - still no one helped me.  Giving up on united. #badservice
negative,@united when an airline causes the missed connection u would think they would take whatever steps to remedy that screw up.
negative,@united I'd thank you - but you didn't help.  taking 6 hours to reply (so I get a message in the middle of the night) isn't actually helpful
negative,@united Flight UA1270 is descending into farce and we haven't left EWR yet. Is this going to get any worse?
negative,"@united I was told it was due to be on UA23 which flies direct to Dublin, so why did it go to London? This is a complete shambles!"
negative,@united 45+ min at EWR baggage claim #stillnobags #ridiculous
negative,"@united On a standby to Denver, which has been delayed, and a confirmed to Aspen, whose flights have been Cancelled Flighted all day. 0 confidence."

positive,@united thank YOU for your kindness. Your agents went above &amp; beyond to get my stranded family home.
negative,@united don't see a justifiable cost to get on an early flight with seats. No airline charges to conveniently get their passengers in early
negative,@united Woke up to notification- flight moved 1.5 hrs early. Barely made flight then 3 hrs layover in SFO - wanted to hop on earlier option
negative,"@united I will do delayed baggage claim when I land. Hopefully the bag isn't broken into, damaged or lost w/c will result in more complaints"
negative,"@united done. Want me to send a screen shot of the second call, which is now at over 45 minutes?"
positive,@united look at this beauty üòâ dc 10 united airlines üòâ http://t.co/MvYoizRPdE

negative,"@united 2 Cancelled Flighted flights Late Flightr, agent claimed she put me on a new flight but then Cancelled Flighted it. Coworker got on flight- now delayed. Now?"
negative,"@United of urgency, but this is ridiculous. Your ceo claims to be customer focused, yet when delays happen, planes sit and customers are"
negative,@united I wasn't asking for a full refund but delaying me 3 hours and giving no reason should be enough to give partial credit
negative,"@United flight was scheduled for 11:56, it's 1:05 and we haven't moved. I have never been on a flight where everyone moved without a sense"
positive,@united ok thx!
negative,@united go to hell
negative,"@united since bulkhead seats cannot have bags on floor, why don't u reserve o/head space above those seats? In 1B on UA246 - not impressed"
negative,@united Would be helpful if you could refresh boarding time info on boarding passes for delayed flights
negative,"@united  18 flights so far this year. 13 delays including 2 Cancelled Flightations.  Late Flightst reason, crew needed mandatory sleep. IN MEXICO!"

negative,@united Flight 211/ORD gate agent tried to prevent me from taking onboard a bag I've used for 15 years! Flight crew was more reasonable!
positive,@united thank you. Literally called for preboarding as I ran up.
negative,@united why do you guys split up the charges to credit cards? Making it unnecessarily more expensive for people to fly with you guys on pts
negative,"@united it was UA381 on 14 Feb. Point is, overselling flights= bad. Making people wait 1hr while you kick them off after boarding is worse"
positive,@united that's brilliant Thankyou so much. Is it classed as part of carryon?
positive,@united thank you for listening to my compliant and doing the right thing. I appreciate you working with me
negative,@united we've been here since 3am and you've Cancelled Flightled our flight twice
negative,@united no chance I wait in ORD all afternoon for another flight after you screwed me. Hold 5396
negative,@united UA5396 can wait for me. I'm on the ground trying to get to the gate after we were moved to B. This is crap.
negative,@united from MEX NRT (dates TBD) but I'm getting a 200 to 300 USD difference in my quotations through September when compared to MEX BKK
negative,@united better just keep connection from ORD To FWA that boards in ten minutes open until I get off the plane that just landed an hour Late Flight

positive,@united Thank you! You need to follow back tho otherwise I can't DM you. X
negative,"@united it's not getting any better. I'd suggest you get a senior manager to this gate , then retrain these gate people"
negative,@united @JMS2802 : nothing like supporting your own mechanics and maintenance workers...instead United puts out a video of TIMCO doing wifi.
positive,@united Just sent! Thanks :)
negative,@united already missed  connection ugh

negative,@united you're the reason this whole travel experience has been a nightmare
negative,@united what a pointless tweet. At least @AmericanAir asked me to follow them to try and resolve
negative,@united that's not even an apology

negative,@united only thing confusing me is why I lost priority boarding? I'm a mileage plus card member üòî
negative,@united We're hoping to hear from you actually.
negative,"@united shes been rescheduled for today, but with the frigid cold, being a possible reason for ""maintenance"" it could be the same issue 2day"
negative,"@united It's the fact that an international should not be with out her bag and no sense of what's going on other than ""maintenance""."
negative,"@united b) I contacted you directly, and the phone service was Laissez Faire at best.  The problem isn't a Cancelled Flightled a flight."
negative,"@united a) she's an international. Her phone is on the fritz, I had to get to Chicago from nearly 4 hrs away to figure everything out."

positive,@united Thanks for the update.
negative,@united and those three people were awesome working very long hours. It is easy to say sorry on Twitter but you should help your ppl @EWR
negative,@united I guess. But what is the excuse for understaffed costumer services? 3 people had to deal with lots of angry passengers. Weather too?
negative,"@united ,now you have Cancelled Flightled my wife and daughter's flt?? What's going on? Follow me so I can dm details."

negative,"@united There is no ""reference number."" Your agent told me to ""just drive to the airport"" because ""I can't reach anyone there to deliver..."""

negative,"@united after a Cancelled Flighted flight, and 2 delays, you lost my luggage AGAIN! You're the WORST! Disgraceful! Awful company, horrible service!"
negative,@united doesn't help the 100 or more passengers that just arrived an hour Late Flight.
negative,@united 40 minutes on tarmac now. That's after 9 hour delay.
negative,@united I am very glad I took care of own rescheduling now that UA 1580 from OGG was Cancelled Flightled. http://t.co/H3k3oWOhD1
negative,@united Tried filling out the status match form and got hit with an error message. How can I tell if it went through? http://t.co/JbDkxd6eFz
negative,@united Is flight 746 going to sit on the tarmac FOREVER?????????
negative,@united One of your workers refused to give me her name as a reference for my notes. Her tone &amp; language was very unprofessional.
negative,@united that's why I blame your company. Because it had every opportunity to do a job and managed to fail each time for just lazy reasons
positive,@united I wanna be grand staff
negative,"@united SF crew lack a lot of customer service, LAX employees are a lot better. Wonder why..."
negative,@united that's why I missed my flight. If the flight had been held for 5 minutes I would have made it. I watched it pull away from the gate
negative,@united also didn't ice the frozen metal walkway. Wasted 40 minutes because no one knew how to do simple jobs.
negative,@united your ground crew was inept and left a truck sitting on the Tarmac. Didn't have a gate agent once we got a gate.
positive,@united I wanna be ride United airline! I love airplane
negative,"@united after 2 days - 1 flight Cancelled Flightled, another delay for 8 hours- united gave me a $7 food voucher. That's how much they value my time??"
negative,@united checked me in through security under the wrong name and given the wrong boarding pass. #AirlineSecurity
negative,"@united what the hell? Flight 746. Delayed since 3 pm, finally boarded and now sitting on the tarmac? Is this f&amp;&amp;%$cking plane Ever leaving?"
negative,"@united Actually, the flight was just Cancelled Flightled! http://t.co/Qf0Oc2HqeZ"
negative,"@united I am a loyal Premier Platinum member, but the lack of communication was really bad. Also, i don‚Äôt see that it has taken off yet"
negative,@united thanks for having changed me. Managed to arrive with only 8 hours of delay and exhausted
negative,"@united This is the 2nd time I was rebooked (w/delays), and for reasons unreLate Flightd to weather. How do I go about requesting a flight voucher?"
negative,"@united If you consider 50 mins for bags @ 10:00pm on a Sunday night ""as fast as they can"", you should reconsider what you think that means."
negative,"@united It's the horrible attitude from staff after , not just the delay. Not the level of service or respect one expects from United"
negative,@united why do you want me to be loyal  if don't let me carry on my bag that easily fits in overhead
negative,@united On top of that I paid for 1st class and my wife got stuck in coach.
negative,@united Ph the pat answers are BS. After I was denied boarding it sat at the gate until 9:05! Your employees totally suck.
negative,"@United Over the last week, United has provided me with the worst customer service experience of my life. Disgusting. #united"
negative,@united 24 hrs since flight landed and ZERO info on my missing bag? rough ETA would be hugely helpful + restore some confidence
negative,@united big surprise #nogate waiting for our plane. Same fucken issues everything I fly you. #fail #worstairlineever
negative,"@united Not to belabor my point,but shouldn't I be able to put a laptop bag above my seat?  Why is it announced to leave it for rollers? Thx"
negative,@united maybemange the airline alittlebetter. Arrived at LAX and no GATE! #howisthatpossible always the same thing w/u
negative,@united I just checked my united app and the most valuable use of this app has been removed. I can no longer see the status of my equipment?
negative,"@united even after running to gate from your connecting flight, your customer service not let us in the plane that was just parked. Stranded"
negative,@united I'm desperately trying to understand how my girlfriend is being treated with this Cancelled Flightled/delayed flight.  #unacceptable #ORD
negative,"@united Nope, no more chances. Your airline messed up both ways of our trip."
negative,@united Why announce it is for rollers at all? If I want to put a coat in there isn't that my choice?  How about all gate checked? Thx
positive,@united you're my early frontrunner for best airline! #oscars2016
negative,"@united  bags left behind because plane overweight, be great if knew as soon as we landed, instead letting us wait 45 minutes with no info."
negative,@united You are a F&amp;$KING joke. Your customer service is woeful. If your staff tell a passenger that they will do something do it!
negative,@united was a sponsor of the oscars? No wonder it was a half hour delayed. #Oscars
positive,@united Worked like a charm. Bag was waiting on the carousel when we got to baggage claim. #welldone #goodflight #friendlysky
negative,@united will lose my bag but won't give me free pretzels #frauds
negative,"@united you are trying to charge me 150 bucks because you lowered your award tickets and I want to get my hard earn points back, total BS"
negative,@united does asap mean two hours worth of delay and a return to the terminal to count the luggage a third time? #gottogetbetter
negative,@united Apart from being on hold for over 2 hours and having talked to 5 people and the problem still not resolved!
negative,"@united typical caned response from UA, fix your crappy performing, last placed/ranked airline in this century!"
negative,@united is it even legal for you guys to advertise flights that you cant honor??
negative,@united customer service is the WORST. hanging up on customers intentionally after one hour on hold.
negative,@united was forced  to book a flight on a different date than originally planned for a higher price $1130 felt like a bait and switch tactic
negative,"@united love how you don't give a shit about people who tried to be loyal, but you screw them every way till Sunday. Glad I've stayed away"
negative,"@united tried a different flight IAH-MNL 4/1/15-4/17/15, 6 flights are advertised for $1038 but are not bookable (due to partner error)."
negative,@united it will be on a different airline.
negative,@united and was told that its been the case for weeks but is still not resolved.
negative,"@united clicked ""upgrade now"" and it didn't upgrade. What gives? http://t.co/N7oSjz8a59"
negative,@united you advertise the flight and its still on you website and still can't be book. spent over 2 hours with united support
negative,@united tried to book a flight IAH-MNL departing 3/31/15 returning 4/17/15 you are advertising 9 flights for $1051 that can't be book!
negative,@united quick (serious) question - any resources/ratings showing the quality of service is better than 8th place? http://t.co/deWIthPeW2
negative,"@united yes I have and I was calling in regards to speaking to someone about it even further, but unfortunately i was just bounced around."
negative,@united Flight 472 from ORD couldn't let me know about this? Found out via app minutes before landing. Awful flight. http://t.co/DQJl8vZ2h2
negative,@united i need help but in spanish
negative,"@united A very disappointing experience - plane mech. delay and next one didn't wait. No sincere apology, just told me to complain online"
negative,@united I lost my sunglasses on the flight from OKC to IAH this morning (8am takeoff) .. is there any way to retrieve them?
negative,@united UA1731 - Denver to Austin...  Still on the ground...
negative,@united either your staff or whoever you contract with at PVD is failing you big time tonight...
negative,@united considering it. Currently gold on @delta. Why should I make the jump for an upcoming flight from SFO to Singapore?
negative,"@united worst flights I've ever had. ground crew ignored our plane, made me miss flight and now I have to cover the cost of a hotel. #DEN"
negative,@united customers aren't dumb. These revenue based programs will hurt everyone. Not gonna save money like you think
negative,@united it was me who had the problem won flight ua 1580. I called and rebooked myself found my own hotel and taxi
positive,@united will do. Thanks for the help. Cheers
negative,"@united bull crap.  I spent $600 on a recent trip.  That's not small change. I got 10,000 AA miles.  Would have only been 6600 UA"
negative,@united yes I did. Terrible service from your courrier
negative,@united compensate us for new clothes bet you won't
positive,@united I have 8 flights with you in the next two weeks :) let's make some good memories!
negative,"@united, we're stuck at OGG, looks like flight will be Cancelled Flightled. Can you help? =)"
negative,@united yea they been booked on 10 next avalible flights since sat 7am. And when time comes no plane 2nd day of work missed #hotelliving
negative,@united currently crying... I wanted to ski tomorrow but prolly not. Just a boy tryna fulfill his dreams
negative,"@united I tried the online tracking and they said something like ""attempting to locate luggage"""
negative,@united your worker told us not to call because we'd be talking to someone in Thailand...
negative,@united - Going on 3 days (tomorrow) and I still haven't received my bag from my flight to Toronto. Would love to see some seriousness here.
negative,@united is there nothing you can do for me? No compensation at all? Given the circumstances I feel like there must be something you can do
negative,@united there is a disconnect between your PR group and the actual business strategy and employee attitude on the ground.  #liars #united
negative,@united here we go again. 2 of 3 segments SFO--New York RT were delayed OVER 2 hrs each! Why do you suck so BAD!?!Maybe another line of bus?
negative,@united you really screwed up dealing mechanical failure from Maui to San Francisco. Poor communication bad help in getting connections
negative,"@united if you don't like delayed bags, why do you let it happen so much?"
negative,@united the delay is due to customer service for 20 people?  What about the DIS-SERVICE you provided for 100+?  #FlightFail #Hour20Delay
positive,@united he is so excellent and so reliable :) #happycustomer
negative,@united but again UNITED DOESNT GIVE 2 SHITS ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS
negative,@united its funny how none of ur tweets back are helpful what I want is to read 'ya we'll change that so our customers get better service'
positive,@united it was delivered! Thank you for making sure it arrived at my doorstep!
negative,"@united really needs to get its act together. Really disappointed in our change of flight, delayed flights, etc."
negative,"@united-rebooked to OMA - 180 miles from my destination. Spotty customer service. I get staff stressors but come on, this is your business."
positive,‚Äú@united: Looking for a reason to travel? #quote http://t.co/GGuIg3t28z‚Äù
negative,@united I can't find any Late Flight evening flights. Are there other airports that would have an overnight flight?
negative,@united Thanks for the vague canned response that doesn't address the issue!
positive,@united thank you!
negative,@united that's not good enough for all of us affected by the awful organization and timing and have now been set back
negative,@united  Otis in the baggage claim by Bay #8. not at all happy but not nearly as pissed.

negative,@united airlines: you kidding? Bagage lost this morning from ny to Washington and still no trace? #badservice
negative,@united I did. It took about an hour and a half though

positive,@united I was sincerely thanking the pilot of flight 4461 of braving the snow and getting me home amongst many other Cancelled Flightlations.
negative,@united Made@it to the gate at 8:23 and they wouldn't let us on. http://t.co/xAToxBnsFa
negative,@united time to give up my 1K status and switch to @Delta - you are so terrible I can't even describe.
positive,"@united Thanks! LOL! #UA6259 will wait for us. Per @flightaware, same tail number as #UA5525 :)"
negative,@united You suck. Flight delayed equipment probs again. Miss connection by 2 minutes and you won't let us on even though it's at the gate.
negative,@United #1758 now going in 40 min waiting for other plane to vacate gate. #findanothergate
negative,@united Flight 2 is 2:30 hrs delayed so far b/c of Late Flight crew. Now we are literally waiting while they have dinner acc. to honest gate agent.
negative,@United many people on Ua6318 are going to miss connections due to long wait time in SFO tarmac. Seriously u can't find an empty gate?
negative,@united You're trying to solve problem of your own making. Charging for checked luggage forces checking at gate. Brilliant.
negative,@united we've been waiting 45 min for a gate at SFO... Yet so many of them are free.  Your excellence in operational efficiency is showing
negative,"@United ""delayed due to customer service"" Huh? http://t.co/XlTV5z6sT1"
negative,@united what about the poor customer service at checkin at Kansas KCI?!? That's it???
negative,@united except all of that delayed the flight anyway.
negative,@United maybe find a different gate #ua1758
negative,@united I sent a message. It's very irresponsible that my suitcase cannot be found. This is truly worst service ever... #fedup #disastrous
negative,@United landed in den on time stuck waiting for gate for 30 min. Maybe an update would be a good idea capt?
negative,@united wanted to point out that not one United crew has been sympathetic. Questions unanswered. MileagePlus is starting to look like a joke
negative,@united can we get an explanation on why UA978 from S√£o Paulo to Houston has been delayed? Now we're hearing from crew about Cancelled Flightlations.
negative,@united Why was flight 1180 EWR to MCO Cancelled Flightled for tomorrow and what do I do to rebook. Asking for a relative.
negative,"@united I understand the intent was not to inconvenience, but catching a cab back to the airport to show them wet clothes wasn't an option."
negative,"@united, wife landed in DC 5hrs ago. luggage did not, was told it would B delivered/Hotel by 8pm. It's now 10pm, no luggage. #UA484"
negative,@united not sure why the people in row 7 that paid for a premium seat can't use their overhead space... http://t.co/i9s86KiHge
negative,@united is so cheap they couldn't afford to run the AC on #UA1510. They took pressure cooker to a new level. #Cheap #WorstAirline
negative,@united why is it that Sundays when my husband travels to Chicago he's stuck at Tarmac &amp; misses connecting flight always
negative,@united Well I can tell you that your customer service at RDU airport is horrific but is exception at O'Hare in Chicago.
negative,@united sitting on UAL 683 - a comedy of errors.  UAL is incompetent
negative,"@united on #UA3785 tonight and told delayed due to Late Flight crew. No idea where crew coming from, your staff ++unhelpful. Any ideas?"
negative,"@united, take a look at status of 683, sitting at ORD ... This ain't cool, yo."
positive,@united bummer but thank you for the quick response
negative,@united I didn't have time to take my wet clothes/suit back to the airport and wasn't going to pay for another cab to do so.
negative,@united didn't realize my bag/ contents were wet until I got to my hotel. Sent my suit/shirts out to be dry cleaned. Mtgs start tomorrow.
negative,"@united You load our plane at ORD knowing pilots are 2 hrs Late Flight, then discover plane needs to be fueled? #WTF #united #incompetent"
negative,@united resolved and im sick and tired of waiting on you. I want my refund and I'd like to speak to someone about it.
negative,@united I'm really glad I just waited on the phone for over an hour to be sent to a voicemail. Your customer service sucks. Nothing has been
negative,"@united, you just caused a riot on the airplane. Never seen anything like this"
negative,"@united Instead of sending inaccurate emails about delay every 5 min, just say we will get you there when we get you there."
negative,@united so glad I've been waiting for 1 hour and 15 minutes and Ive been transferred 3 times without resolving anything. Worst service ever.
negative,@united we still need help. Hung up on twice. Customer service rep said there is no way to help between the gate rep and phone rep.
positive,"@united They let us know in advance of the reboot, yes :) Thanks for the attentiveness!"
negative,@united lol too little too Late Flight
negative,@united yes. Bags came 1 hr after I arrived at baggage claim. Awful experience on the ground at BHM
negative,@united @FernHeinig18 your delay is due to your own making. We have now been back to the gate multiple times. Maybe take accountability
negative,@united Why do I have to give up my leg room so these 4 people (not in my row) can fill the bin?  Pls start charging. http://t.co/2nY5TuXFqf
negative,@united please tell CLT flight 4232 needs a gate. Waiting now for 15 mins.
negative,@united Why did you load us in this flying sardine can if you knew the pilots were 2 hours Late Flight?? #incompetent beyond belief
negative,@united your seats are god awful.

negative,@united I'm on UA1118 and my direct tv isn't working.  How do I avoid this in future?
negative,@United is truly the drunk uncle of boarding. Don't believe gate agent that overhead is full; don't reserve aisle http://t.co/cdZhTyd0aK
negative,@united i sure will
negative,"@united, any options to cos tonight? Doesn't look like #UA5525 will make it in time for #UA6259. Should I reserve a hotel room?"
negative,"@united Appreciated, but in this case we waited an extra 55 minutes for a lost mechanic to fax the log. Fax...like in the 80s."
negative,@united customer service sucks!  They hang up after waiting an hour and talking for 5 minutes.
negative,@united JP - DM message who? Can't get a DM through to @united
negative,@united strikes again! Why board anyone if there's something wrong with the plane? Common sense.
negative,@united:  thanks for the miserable trip GNV&lt;&lt;&lt;FSD on 2.19-2.21.
negative,@united Missed KTM flight due to ur Cancelled Flightlation. Mike supervisor disgusting.  Now day Late Flight. No apology or upgrade offer to LHR from ORD???

negative,@united is the worst airlines sitting on the plane at  Houston-bush airport now for an hour and a half waiting for Late Flight passengers
negative,@united might possibly have the worst service on the planet.
negative,@united deceptive marketing practices promised me if i booked flights i would retain my status now they are not granting. Neverflyunited
negative,@united Hey so many time changes for UA 1534. We going tonight or what? MIA - EWR
negative,@united and that it would be sent on the next flight to Hayden/steamboat (HDN) from Denver. So I'm hoping its on there
negative,@united and pick it up and just bring it on the shuttle. When I went to double check on that they said it was still on the concourse
negative,@united I honestly couldn't tell you. All I know is that originally we were going to have it brought in from the concourse
negative,@united missing a day of vacation to see my husband because of this delay but stuff happens and I get that. Just wish it was handled better
negative,@united UA1534 has now had 11 different departure times. Wtf. Make up your mind.

negative,@united this airline is a joke my friends been trapped in houston since 7am sat and have no flight in sight #unitedworstever #trappedhouston
negative,@united why do you hate your passengers?
negative,@united how can a plane that has been sitting in a hanger all day have numerous mechanical problems. Doesn't anyone actually do maintenance
negative,.@united in the future when delay causes 15 hour wait (slept night in airport) ensuring seating choice for replacement flight would be good.

negative,@united @MaxAbrahms *if* he needs assistance? Do you expect him to go on a Scooby Doo tour of terminals until he finds his stuff?
negative,Thanks @united for writing back. To assist you can return the bag you lost &amp; clean up the feces sprinkled in your bathroom. Too much to ask?
negative,@united you hung up on me again.
negative,"@united your ""customer service"" team in manilla is absolute shit. I can't even get a supervisor without being out back on hold?!"
negative,@united it's disgusting and unconscionable the treatment I've received tonight.

negative,@united @ThisIsCoach Every time my united flight got delayed. this is a big frustration.
negative,@united you've got to be kidding me. I still haven't talked to a human and your robotweeting me?! And asking for a follow????
negative,".@united I wouldn't describe feces sprinkled in your bathroom as an inconvenience. To help, you might find my baggage you lost &amp; return it."
negative,@united and the fact that we were treated disrespectfully and lied to by members of your airline that claims to strive for the best
negative,"@united is that all that matters, not the fact that we're at a different destination, we were put through a tremendous amount of stress,"
negative,@united 1k member broken seat back broken tv broken light lost bag  gee thnx. UA922 awesome job
negative,@united absolutely disgusting the way you treat your customers. Isn't there anyone actively monitoring your Cust serve? This is  unreal!!
negative,@united nice. I wonder how you pick who to respond to? Maybe only happy customers are easier. I wonder how many of those you have left.
negative,@united averaging 200 minute wait times tonight or what? I've gotten no help from you tonight.
negative,@united thanks for nothing. Really?!? 60 minute wait times when I've had to call back 4x. That's 240minute wait times.
negative,@united you're customer service is unbelievably bad. Abysmal. I've been on the phone for well over 2hrs tonight. Hung up on by yr ppl 3x.
negative,@united you can read the full story when I submit a case to your team about the pilot of flight 6232 and why we are sleeping in DIA
negative,@united an inconvenience is a weather delay. Your pilot deciding to waste enough time so the FAA wouldn't let him fly is negligence.
negative,@united I bought a ticket with a price that was published by mistake and now I got an email that indicates United Cancelled Flightled my ticket! Why?
negative,@united new 737 plane; wifi: not working. Entertainment: non existent. New Seats: seriously uncomfortable. Really? #unitedfail UA1550

negative,@united I'm a first time solo female traveller and it's pretty scary being in a foreign place not knowing where your belongings are...
negative,"@united I am. Who knows where my bags are. Do I just wait around and hope they arrive? No one has answers, I have plans and no answers...."
negative,@united somehow I knew that you'd wait until I was airborne to respond. #hacks #jokers #neveragain.

negative,@united I'm rebooked on a flight tomorrow even though I had 1st class seat orig I have a lousy coach seat
negative,@united well this one missed the mark.  She was in a snit from the minute I stepped up to the counter

negative,@united we've been seating for 5hrs inside flight UA936 at #IAD delayed. We've only been offered water &amp; cookies in business class. #failed
negative,@united please get me off this plane #UA57
negative,@united have since dropped to 2 layovers but still not acceptable.

negative,"@united boarding was decent, 3 useless agents that don't speak English (after 2.5hrs of hold) 6hrs of mech delay not so much"
negative,@united flight was Cancelled Flighted after the last opportunity to rebook us on other flights this evening passed.
negative,@united boarding a #plane would be much faster if you boarded back to front instead of front to back #MakesSense #efficiency #travel #flying
negative,"@united it's 9:56, and the desk attendant stated we would ""sit awhile"" until given the all clear. Lack of communication seems to the norm."
negative,@united had been suffering immensely ever since this merge .. Hopefully I'll never have to fly @united ever again ..
negative,@united I'd really like to get off of this plane now.
negative,@united possibly the worst airlineGave them three chances Second time in 2 weeks a flight has been delayed and or Cancelled Flightled due to mechanics
negative,@united cabin pressurization issues are pretty serious. Flight 1109 landed in Washington because of it. My head is pounding.

negative,@united My contact stuff is in the bag and I'm legally blind. This is so messed up.
negative,@united Did I mention that I was ON THE PLANE so is my luggage. My luggage that I'm not going to have for how many days.

negative,"@united Yeah, I tried that about 10 times for two different tickets, and it told me to ""Try again Late Flightr""."
negative,@united please fire the captain of flight 6232 today. He single handedly ruined every passengers day by being a piece of shit. #unitedsucks

negative,.@united Your airline is again rated the WORST in America so you've got your work cut out for you. It's bc you treat customers like garbage.
negative,@united Pay for my hotel.... I'm a broke student #help
negative,@united all 4 of us are on standby in Houston tomorrow for flights to Calgary. If you could get us on one or two of those that would help

negative,"@united Still do not have my bag, it's in the CLT airport. Was originally told I would have it by 2pm."
negative,@united just texted me to say flight is delayed due to air traffic control. BS! They pulled the plane in Late Flight #lies

negative,"@united thank you for leaving my bag in houston! despite what your system says, i was definitely on the flight!"
negative,@united how come a $27 shuttle bus from LGA to EWR has electrical power outlets but our new Airbus interiors do not? #whyjeff?
negative,Reply to @united - Doesn't do any good to check outlets preflight when moved to different equipment after boarding due to malfunction.
negative,@united 15-hr flight w/broken #Dreamliner media system. Witness #mental #breakdown as we bounce off walls. Remind me why I'm 1K.

negative,"@united yes, after landing at 930pm last night. Spoke to 10 baggage claim customer service reps. Finally spoke to one amazing ticket agent."
negative,@united Charging $6500 for biz flight to UK = somewhat egregious. Charging $3 on top for a Sam Adams draft at the United Club is usurious.

negative,"@united really needs to start upgrading their planes. No TVs &amp; then the ""inflight wifi"" is currently unavailable #UnitedAirlines"
negative,@united I am not digging the new mileage earning plan. I would earn about 1/3 of the miles I do now. Any changes to the award ticket prices?
negative,@united outsourcing ticket and gate agents at MIA. Ill advised. You did it in ROC and service went downhill. Keep employees and fliers first
negative,@united Was just hung up on by customer service after waiting 30 min on hold...guess that vacation's not happening? Website wasn't working.
negative,@united bad idea to let 200 people back on the terminal with food vouchers but allow only 15 minutes to get anything.  Long lines!! #ua1523
negative,@united what's going on with the mileage plus accounts? Login through username and email have been down for at least three days.

negative,@united just had the worst customer service experience ever on united airlines
negative,@united airlines 1st &amp; only time I ever fly your airline! What a disgrace. @JimTrotter_NFL I should've listened to your tweet! #HORRIBLE
negative,"@united diverged to Burlington, Vermont. This sucks."
negative,@united officially has the most inefficient boarding procedure. There is no reason it should take 45 mins to board a plane!
negative,@united 3 hours of sitting in the plane that hasn't left the Gate yet. 6 more hours of actual flying left.
negative,@united I sent my details to the customer care link you sent me almost a month ago and no response.
